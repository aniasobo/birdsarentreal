# Do help

I'm an early career developer so apologies for the quality of this code. Want to help me improve it? That would be SO DOPE, MAN!

Here's what I'd love help with:

* we can always have more/better regex
* replaced text could be made more readable if every nth instance of the word `bird` could be replaced with a different string than `government drone` but would that be performant?
* refactor of the main function to make it ignore urls, for example in google search results

Things I'm currently working on:

* can I use this script on other browsers? I probably could ðŸ¤”
* an on/off disable/enable popup
* a separate function for `title` text replacement
